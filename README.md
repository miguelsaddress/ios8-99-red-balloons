 Solution to the 99 Red Balloons challenge of the iOS8 course.
 
 The problem to be solved is generating 99 aleatory structs, containing the number of balloon (the iteration number) and the picture to be used as a background image.
 
 I created a struct containing the number as Int and the image path / name instead of letting the struct contain a whole UImage object.
